# Code Review

When running the app the two route components were not resolved in my test environment. More important the fetch request would never work as the first promise returns a response object and not the actual json data. Async / await still makes sense but only if then() and catch() are used correctly with fetch().
Other comments relate more to the structure, readable and maintainability of the application as well as destructuirng and reassigning varianles / constants more efficiently.

{;ease read other more specific notes in the code and compare GIT commits.

## Missing

The app uses a router, but has no meny. This should be a separate component with properties mapped to the redux store.

## To Do

Redux state management is only used for the navigation. When the reduce store is hooked up the app's main file (index.js), it is not mapped to properties or used for other data sets, such as the list of breweries or user status.

# Standard Installation Notes

This project was bootstrapped with a fork of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scrips

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
